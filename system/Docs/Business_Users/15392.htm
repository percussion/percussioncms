<h1 class="heading1">Moving Active Assembly Items Across Sites</h1>
<p class="bodytext">In an Active Assembly relationship, the dependent item's Site and Folder may be properties in the Relationship. If the Site and Folder are properties of the Relationship, a user cannot use the normal <em class="emphasis">Move</em> action to move the dependent item in the Relationship from its original Site to another Site because its Active Assembly link will be broken. Likewise, a user cannot use the normal <em class="emphasis">Remove</em> action to remove the dependent item from its original Site.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Rhythmyx provides special <em class="emphasis">Force Move</em> and <em class="emphasis">Force Remove</em> actions, which reset the Site and Folder properties and the link addresses. By default, these actions are only assigned to administrators in administrator Communities.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Rhythmyx displays an Error Message if a user attempts to move a dependent to another Site or to remove a dependent whose Site and Folder are properties in an Active Assembly relationship:</p>
<p class="widegraphic"><img src="errorforcemove.gif" alt="Move Error" height="266" width="623" vspace="2" hspace="2" align="bottom" border="0"></p>
<p class="bodytext">If the Site is a property of the Relationship, but the Folder is not, the behavior is similar. However, if the dependent item appears in more than one Folder on the Site, a user can perform a common Move or Remove action on the item until the dependent item only appears once on the Site. At that point, a Move or Remove action triggers the dialog shown above and an administrator must use a Force Move or Force Remove action to move/remove the item and reset the links.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A user can move a dependent whose Site (and Folder) are properties of an Active Assembly Relationship from a Site Folder to a non-Site Folder.  The original Site remains a property of the Relationship and the Folder is updated. For details of how Site and Folder properties of Relationships change when a dependent item is moved between different types of Folders, see the document <em class="emphasis">Implementing the Relationship Engine</em>.  </p>
<p class="note">By default, the FastForward sample Active Assembly Relationships do not include Site and Folder properties. <a id="h15399" class="jumptemplate" title="How Relationships Acquire Site or Folder Properties" href="17112.htm" target="_self">Site and Folder properties are included in Active Assembly Relationships when they are displayed in the search results.</a></p>
