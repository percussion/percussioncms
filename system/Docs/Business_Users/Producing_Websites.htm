<h1 class="heading1">Producing Websites</h1>
<p class="bodytext">If you are the Web site producer in your company, you use the content that contributors have entered to create Web pages.  You decide which content appears together on which pages and add links and navigation to the pages. Rhythmyx provides an Active Assembly Interface, which displays Content Items as assembled Templates that you can edit to add and change related content items and links.  You can access the Active Assembly Interface for specific Content Items in Content Explorer's main view, or for an entire Web Site using the Site Explorer drop list.  You can rearrange content and links in the Active Assembly Interface, and even edit Content Items and create new Content Items for specific Slots.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Once you have accessed the Active Assembly Interface, see the Help and Tutorial accessible from the Interface for information about how to use it.</p>
