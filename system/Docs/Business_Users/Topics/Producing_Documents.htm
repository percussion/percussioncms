<h1 class="heading1">Producing Documents</h1>
<p class="bodytext">You can use Rhythmyx to create and arrange content for documents as well as Web sites. When your document is ready for publishing, you can send it to Quark, Adobe Acrobat, or another application that formats the document and saves it to file. This option gives you the ability to put the same content into different formats.  For example, you could use portions of the content on your Web site in a document that you send out to customers. </p>
<p class="bodytext">A Rhythmyx document usually consists of a single owner Content Item with a Template that defines the overall structure of the document.  The Slots in this Template include the sections of the document, such as Chapters and Appendices. The related Content Items that you include in these Slots contain the content of the document. </p>
<p class="bodytext">For example, a document Template for the owner Document Content Item could contain two Slots, one that holds any number of Chapter Content Items and one that holds any number of Appendix Content Items.  For each Document Content Item, you could include the appropriate Chapter and Appendix Content Items.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Because most formatting of the printed document is completed in the third party application, the Templates that you apply to the dependents, such as Chapters and Appendices, do not  apply formatting, but specify which fields in the Content Item to include.  For example, a Chapter Template might include the Title and Body, but a Cross Reference Template might only include the Title. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Rhythmyx's Document Assembly window helps you process documents by letting you assign content to the Slots available for a specific Content Item</p>
