<h2 class="heading2">Setting Up Word to Use Rhythmyx</h2>
<p class="bodytext">When you use a Word-based Content Editor, you can either enter the Content Editor through Rhythmyx and launch Word, or open Word, enter the content, and upload the content to Rhythmyx when you save the document.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When you use Word to enter Rhythmyx content the Word document that you are creating must have a Rhythmyx-enabled Word template attached to it. The Rhythmyx-enabled Word template provided by Percussion is <code class="monospace">rxwordsample.dot</code>; your System Administrator will provide you with the name and location of the template that you should use . The default Word template cannot save your documents in the correct format or access Rhythmyx. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Many users only have to install the Rhythmyx-enabled template when Rhythmyx is initially installed; other users must reattach the Rhythmyx-enabled template each time Rhythmyx is updated.   Your System Administrator will instruct you as to when you must attach  the template and which of the following methods to use to attach it.  </p>
<ul class="listbullet"><li class="listbullet">After Rhythmyx is installed or updated, open your first Rhythmyx Word document after upgrade through the [<strong class="buttons">Launch Word</strong>] button in the Word-based Content Editor to automatically attach the template to Word. If you open your first Rhythmyx Word document directly in Word, the new template will not be attached.</li><li class="listbullet">Your System Administrator will send you the  Rhythmyx-enabled template and instruct you to copy it into your Word template directories and possibly, to attach it as the default Word template. See your Microsoft Word online help for instructions for attaching a template.</li></ul><p class="note">If you open Word to enter a Rhythmyx document and you no longer see the buttons for accessing Rhythmyx and the styles necessary for creating the Content Type, your Rhythmyx-enabled template has become unattached, and you should refer to Microsoft Word's online help for instructions on attaching it.</p>
