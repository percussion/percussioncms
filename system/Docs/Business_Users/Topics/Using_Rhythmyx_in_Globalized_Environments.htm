<h1 class="heading1">Using Rhythmyx in Globalized Environments</h1>
<p class="bodytext">If your Rhythmyx environment is globalized, it has more than one Locale.  A Locale specifies a language including its regional variation, such as French Canadian or American English. The default Locale is always US English. You may also have other Locales. If you have more than one Locale, you must choose your <a id="h6839" class="" title="Locales" href="Locales.htm" target="_self">Locale</a> when you log in to Rhythmyx. The language of labels on your Rhythmyx interface, such as menu options, Content Editor field names, and buttons, automatically changes depending on your Locale. For example, the following graphics show a Content Explorer interface in its US English Locale and in its French Locale.</p>

<p class="widegraphic"><img src="cxfrench.gif" alt="French locale" height="543" width="912" vspace="2" hspace="2" align="bottom" border="0"></p>
<p class="bodytext">A globalized Rhythmyx environment can have Content Explorer and Site Explorer interfaces in different languages and may give you the option of creating Translation Copies of Content Items. </p>
<p class="bodytext">If your Rhythmyx environment is globalized, you may have the Action Menu option <a id="h6879" class="jumptemplate" title="Creating Translation Content Items" href="Creating_Translation_Content_Items.htm" target="_self">Create Translation</a>. You may create one Translation Copy of a Content Item for each Locale in your CMS. When you create a Translation Copy of a Content Item, you make a new Copy of the Item, its links, and its dependencies.  Rhythmyx does not actually translate the content; you must translate it manually.    </p>
