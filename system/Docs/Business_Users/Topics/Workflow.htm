<h3 class="heading3">Workflow</h3>
<p class="bodytext">Each content item in the system exists in a Workflow.  Workflows define the process of creating and managing content by defining the stages in the process, controlling the status of content items through the process, determining which users can access the items at each stage in the process, and determining whether or not a content item is eligible to be published.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In Rhythmyx, a Workflow consists of a series of States.  A State is a phase in the Workflow in which one or more users can modify, review, or approve the content item.  The State determines which users have access to the document.  Only users in a Role assigned to the current State of the content item can access the content item.</p>
<p class="bodytext">At least one State in each Workflow is defined as a Public State.  A Public State is a State in which a content item is eligible to be published.    </p>
<p class="bodytext">Each user in Rhythmyx is assigned to one or more Roles.  Rhythmyx grants access to content items based on the user's Role.  One or more Roles are assigned to each State in the Workflow.  If a user is in one of the Roles assigned to a State, that user can access any Content Item in that State.  If the user is not in a Role associated with the current State of the Content Item, the user cannot access the Content Item.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The movement of Content Items from one State to another State is referred to as a Transition in Rhythmyx.</p>
