<h3 class="heading3">Disabling Full-text Search</h3>
<p class="bodytext">To disable the full-text search engine, uncheck the <em class="emphasis">Enabled</em> checkbox on the Full-text Search tab of the Search tab in the Server Administrator.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Disabling the full-text search engine is intended as a temporary measure on development servers only.  It is not intended to be used on production servers.  Nor is it intended to facilitate a permanent conversion from the full-text search engine to the light-weight database search engine.  </p>
<p class="bodytext">When you disable the full-text search engine, any pre-defined searches you have configured in the View/Search Editor in the Rhythmyx Workbench will be unavailable for modification.  In the Content Explorer, these searches will still function, but they will use the light-weight database search engine functionality rather than the full-text search functionality, so running the search may return different results.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Any existing user-defined saved searches in Content Explorer that were created using the full-text search engine that are saved again while it is disabled will be converted to use the light-weight database search engine.  They cannot be converted back to use the full-text search engine.  If you convert a saved search accidentally while the full-text search engine is disabled, you will have to recreate it after enabling the full text search engine.</p>
<p class="bodytext">You determine whether or not individual fields will be included in full-text searches in the Rhythmyx Workbench's Field Properties Editor by checking or unchecking <strong class="specialbold">Allow this field to be searched</strong>. See the topic <em class="emphasis">Field Properties Editor</em> in the Workbench online help for more information.</p>
