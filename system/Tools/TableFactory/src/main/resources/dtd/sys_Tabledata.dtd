<!--
  A set of one or more tables, each defining its own set of data.
-->
<!ELEMENT tabledataset (table+)>
<!--
  A list of zero or more rows of data.

  Attributes:
  name - The name of the table. This MUST be the simple table name, it will
      be fully qualified internally.
  onCreateOnly - Only process the supplied data if the table is being created.
      yes - Do not process the data if the table does not already exist and is
            being created. This is the default.
      no -  Process the data whether or not the table is being created.
-->

<!--
  A child table within a preceeding row of data. The key relationship is
  defined by the foreign key relationships.

  Attributes:
  name - The name of the child table. This MUST be the simple table name,

<!--
  A row of data, defined by one or more columns.

  Attributes:
  action - The action to take with the specified row of data.
      n - Insert the row. This is the default action.
      u - Update the row, based on the primary key columns defined in the
          tabledef Xml file, or if update columns are defined, using those
          instead.
      r - Replace the row. This means insert if a matching row does
          not already exist, or update it if it does, using update columns
          if defined, otherwise based on the primary key columns.
      d - Delete the row, based on the primary key columns defined in the
          tabledef Xml file, or if update columns are defined, using those
          instead.
