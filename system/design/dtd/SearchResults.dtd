   This DTD specifies the format of XML documents produced for search
   results.
   
   xml:lang - the language in which the dynamic data elements are 
      provided.
   selectionMode - specifies if the results produced are for multiple or
      single selection, e.g. the results are used to link items to slots
      versus they are used to link items to inline links.
   tabsize - the tab size as used for category indentation. It defines the
      width of the 'spacer.gif' inserted depending on the category level.
      Defaults to 10 if not specified.

   This element defines all table header information, such as column
   labels and data types.
-->
<!ELEMENT Header (HeaderColumn+)>
<!--
   This element defines all column meta information.
   
   label - the column display label. It is expected to be in the language as
      specified in the 'xml:lang' attribute of the document element.
   width - the column width in percent. Only non categorized columns have 
      this attribute. The sum of all non categorized column width must add 
      up to 100%.
   type - the data type fo the column data. This value determines how the
      data for the column is used. If Image, then the data is interpreted 
      as a url to the actual image, all others are intepreted as text.
   isCategory - specifies whether this column is a category column or a
      normal data column as specified by the display format. It may be 
      used by the renderer to group the data in a tree or tree-like 
      structure.
   sorted - if present this attribute specifies that this is the sorted
      column, either 'ascending' or 'descending'. This is used to display
      the correct image for the sorted column.

<!ELEMENT Results (Row+)>
<!--
   A data row. Categories are only expected in rows where they change

<!ELEMENT Categories (Column+)>
<!--
   The column value, expected in the language as specified in the
   'xml:lang' attribute of the document element for all data types except
   'Image'. For data type 'Image', this is the relative path to the image
   resource, e.g. '../sys_resources/images/add.gif' of the Rhythmyx
   application producing an XML document with this format.
   The <JavaScript> element can be used as UI hint to render the column
   as link. The script will be executed if that link is followed.
   
   categoryLevel - the category level if this is a category column. The
      level starts with '0' and is incremented by '1' for each level. This
      information can be used to render category indentations.
