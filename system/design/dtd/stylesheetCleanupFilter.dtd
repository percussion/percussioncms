Allowed Attribute specifies attributes which are allowed by the
enclosing namespace. The name attribute can contain Glob type
wildcards:

   Wildcard characters:
      * = 0 or more of any char
      ? = 1 instance of any char
      
   Examples:
   <allowedAttribute name="foo"/>  this will allow the foo attribute for this namespace 
   <allowedAttribute name="bar*/> this will allow any attribute that starts with bar 
   <allowedAttribute name="*"/> this will allow any attribute for this namespace

<!-- 
Allowed Element specifies elements which are allowed by the
enclosing namespace. The name attribute can contain Glob type
wildcards:

      * = 0 or more of any char

Allowed Namspace specifies a namespace which will be allowed by the cleanup filter and
will therefore not be removed by the namespace cleanup. The name attribute should contain the name
of the namespace to be allowed, it cannot contain wildcard characters. It may be empty to specify the base namespace.

The declAllowed attribute is a boolean value that specifies if that a namespace declaration is allowed for the namespace
(i.e xmlns:foo="http://www.foo.com/bar"). If the declAllowed attribute is set to true or yes than the declValue should be specified, this
is used to make sure the namespace declaration's URI matches, it can contain wildcards.

 Wildcard characters:
      * = 0 or more of any char
      ? = 1 instance of any char

Examples:

   The following example allows a namespace declaration for 'foo' as long as it contains
  'bar' somewhere in the URI:
   
   <allowedNamespace name="foo" declAllowed="true" declValue="*bar*">
      ...
  </allowedNamespace>    
  
  The following example allows a namespace declaration for 'dog' that can have any URI:
  
  <allowedNamespace name="dog" declAllowed="true" declValue="*">
      ...
  </allowedNamespace>
  
  The following example does not allow any namespace declaration for 'xml':
  
    <allowedNamespace name="xml" declAllowed="false">
      ...
  </allowedNamespace>

The stylesheet cleanup filter is used by the stylesheet namespace cleanup to determine what namespaces and namespace
parts are allowed (will not be removed ) during cleanup.
