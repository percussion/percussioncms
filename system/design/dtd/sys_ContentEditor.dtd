   An editor is a collection of fields used for entering, editing and viewing
   the content and the instructions for displaying these fields and a
   collection of system information.

   Content:
   DisplayError - If a validation error occurs, this contains the general
         message about the failure(s).

   VariantList - Contains the variants for preview. Only present when the
         mode is sys_preview.

   ActionLinkList - Contains a set of named actions such as add or update,
         that are appropriate for the current page. The style sheet should
         use these actions to create the UI for the end user and assign the
         URL to the UI item.


   Attributes:
   docType - Is this page the result of a user request for an editor, or is it
         the result of a validation failure during a modification request.
         If mode is sys_preview, this will always be sys_normal.

   mode - A flag to indicate whether this document was built for previewing
         the data or editing it.

   commandName - The internal name of the command handler that is serving
         up this document. It is the command param passed with the original
         request for this editor.

   submitHref - The target of the submit button for the form used to edit
         this data.

   contentTypeId - The unique identifier for the content type that this editor
         handles. This is also available in the ContentStatus node, if workflow
         information is present.

   enableRelatedContent - This boolean specifies whether or not this content
         editor has related content enabled. The flag is optional and defaults to
         'no' if not provided.

   objectType - This is an integer that specifies the type of 'content' being
         generated by this editor. The allowed values come from the OBJECTS
         table. It is an optional attribute that defaults to 1 (item).
         Values other than 1 are reserved for system use.
         
   itemLocale - This is the locale of the item that is to be edited.

   producesResource - This is a boolean flag to specify whether the items created by 
         this content editor or of resource type or not. A resource generally requires
         location to publish like images, files etc.

   All of the UI descriptors and data needed by the control to display the
   field.

   Content:
   Value, Table - Data set to be displayed by the control. Which
         element is present can be determined by the dataType attribute.
         If the data is empty, the element is not present. A Table is used
         for child data because it is a collection of rows.

   DisplayChoices - If the control is a choice list control, this element
         contains all the possibilities including the selected status.

   ParamList - a collection of custom parameters to be interpretted by the
         control. The control documentation should be used to determine
         params that will have an effect on the control. Typically, custom
         params are optional, although the control can deem them required.

   Attributes:
   name - the name of the control, used to find it in the control library.

   paramName - HTML field name, is unique among all fields in this item. When
         the data is submitted, the control is responsible to make sure the
         value(s) entered by the user is assigned to a param(s) by this name.

   dataType - An enumeration to indicate where this field originated, either
         system, shared or editor specific.

   dimension - An enumeration describing what form the data takes. There are
         3 forms. Either it's a single value, multiple values or a child.
         The value of this attribute is used to determine the data element.
         'single' uses the 'Value' element. 'array' has no data
         element and 'table' (2 dimensional array) uses the Table element.
         If table is set, the associated ActionLink param name will be set to
         sys_childid and the value will be set to this child's id. The
         command handler will save the content like a normal submit, the
         redirect to the child summary page.

   isReadOnly - A flag to indicate whether this field is read-only.

   isRequired - A flag to indicate whether this field must have a validated
         value before the document transitions to another state. It does not
         mean the field must be filled out before the document can be
         successfully saved.

   hasBinaryData - A flag that is present if the field is a binary field and
         the field has data. Data for binary fields is never included in the
         output doc. The attribute is not present unless its value is true.

   clearBinaryParam - The name of the parameter that will be posted with a yes
         or no value to determine whether this control's binary field will be cleared.
   accessKey - The accessKey for the control.

   An action that can be taken by the end user. They are meant to be used

   an action that appends all name/value pairs specified in the Param objects

   us to decouple the widget text from the submitted value.

   semantics of the button element.

   value.
