<!ELEMENT PSXDatabaseFunctionsColl (PSXDatabaseFunction*)>
<!-- 
   Each PSXDatabaseFunction groups all of the definitions for a standard fct
   name for all supported drivers of that function. Not every driver
   supported by Rx must support every function. The workbench will filter
   the list based on the db for the given resource. If multiple dbs are used
   in a resource, the intersection set is used. The server will not validate
   these functions. If an invalid one is entered by manually editing the
   application xml, a runtime exception will occur.

   Attributes:
      standardFunctionName - name of the database function. 
                             This is case-insenstive, so two or more PSXDatabaseFunction
                             elements should not have the value for this attribute differing
                             only in case.

<!ELEMENT PSXDatabaseFunction (PSXDatabaseFunctionDef*)>
<!ATTLIST PSXDatabaseFunction

<!-- 
   The actual definition of the function for a specific database.
   Attributes:
      standardFunctionName - must be the same as the attribute by the same
      name in the containing node.
      
      driver - The jdbc subprotocol used by the driver. For example, "inetdae7" or "db2" or "oracle:thin".
               The value of this attribute is case-sensitive.

               This attribute may not be specified or specified as "*" for the first PSXDatabaseFunctionDef 
               element, in which case this database function definition is considered
               the default function definition. 
               Default function definition will be used unless there is another 
               PSXDatabaseFunctionDef element defined with a matching driver name.
               If a default function defintion has been provided then subsequent 
               definitions for the same function can specify only the elements which
               differ from the default defintion (that is, override the default value). 
               For example, just provide the Body or Description element or Param elements. 
               Database function definition for such cases will be constructed using 
               the default database function definition and the database function 
               definition for the matching driver.

<!-- 
   There should be a replacement parameter for every parameter of the 
   function. For example, the substring function may have the following Body:
      
         SUBSTR({0}, {1}, {2})
         
   Where {0} will be replaced at run time with the dynamically generated 
   value as specified by the definition of the first parameter, {1} by the 2nd
   parameter, and so on. It is an error if the number of expected parameters 
   doesn't match the number of actual parameters.

   The function parameters should be specified in ascending order. The first
   argument to the function should be {0} and second {1} and so on. 
   
   A function parameter can also be specified in the format shown below. This should be used
   if the function parameter value needs to be assigned based on the first non-null and
   non-empty value from a list of choices.
   
   {0,choice,0#firstArg|1#secondArg}
   
   In this example, the first parameter to the function will be assigned value as follows:
   
   1> If the runtime value of the first parameter to the function is non-null and non-empty
         then it will be used.
         
   2> If the runtime value of the first parameter to the function is null or empty, then the
         second parameter to the function will be evaluated. If it is non-null and non-empty
         then it will be used.
         
    3> If both first and second parameters are null or empty then null will be used (and hence
          "Omit if Null" should be specified if all parameters in the choice list can be null or empty)
          
   
   There is no limit to the number of choices in the choice list. Here are some other examples 
   of function body containing choice list.
   
   FUNC1BODY( {0} , {1,choice,1#secondArg|2#thirdArg} , {3} )
   
   FUNC2BODY( {0} , {1} {2,choice,2#thirdArg|3#fourthArg|4#fifthArg|5#sixthArg})
   
   FUNC3BODY( {0} {1,choice,1#secondArg|2#thirdArg} , {3} ,  {4})
   
   FUNC4BODY( {0} , {1} {2,choice,2#thirdArg|3#fourthArg} , {4} ,  {5,choice,5#sixthArg|6#seventhArg|7#eighthArg} , {8} , {9} )

<!ELEMENT Body (#PCDATA)>
<!--
   The content of this element is a Description element which provides details
   about the parameter.
   
   Attributes:
      name - name of the parameter
      type - type of the parameter. If the parameter expects numberic values, specify the type as "number".  
      staticBind - Whether the database function param value should be bound statically,
					or dynamically. For static binding, the function parameter value is
					evaluated and subsituted in the body of the function. For dynamic
					binding, a "?" is subsituted for the parameter value in the function
					body and the actual value is bound before statement execution using
					one of the <code>java.sql.PreparedStatement.setXXX()</code> methods 
					(based on the type of the parameter - number, text or array)
