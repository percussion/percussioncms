<!ENTITY % BasicObjects SYSTEM "sys_BasicObjects.dtd">
%BasicObjects;
<!--

   Attributes:
   name - The internal name of the control.

   displayName - The name to show the user in control lists. If not supplied,
         the name is used.

   dimension - An enumeration describing what form the data takes. There are
         3 forms. Either it's a single value, multiple values or a 2D array.
         Describes the form of data expected by the control. A control for
         single data expects 0 or 1 value. A control for array data expects
         0 or more values. Both types return values. A control for a table
         is not expected to return any data, it is read only. It is expected
         that controls that take array data use choice lists.

   choiceset - Provided as a hint as to whether this control uses a set of
         choices from which the user can choose 1 or more values. 'required'
         means that a set of choices must be provided (see sys_ContentEditor.dtd
         for details) or it is an error condition. 'optional' means they will be
         used if they are present. 'none' means they are not needed and will be
         ignored if provided. This property is only applicable if the dimension
         property is single or array.
         
   deprecate - Indicates if this control is deprecated.
   
   replacedwith - Used in conjunction with deprecated, this attribute indicates 
         which control should be used in placed of the deprecated control.

   This element should include a full description of the control's behavior
   and any allowed parameters (names and allowed values). If the allowed
   parameter set is large, then a description of the params without Param
   elements is ok (e.g. if all attributes for HTML buttons are allowed).
   Submitted params that are passed through should set the type attribute of
   the Param element to 'html'.
-->
<!ELEMENT psxctl:Description (#PCDATA)>
<!--
   The file list for things like script files that need to be included in the
   output.  Typically, these files are referenced by the control template.
-->
<!ELEMENT psxctl:AssociatedFileList (psxctl:FileDescriptor+)>
<!--
   Attributes:
   name - the name of the file (base and extension)

   type - a general descriptor for the type of content in the file

   mimetype - A more specific descriptor of the type of content in the file.

   originalLocation - The fully qualified path to the file where it was read
         when uploaded to the server from the designer's agent. If unknown,
         it will not be present. This will only be used by the agent to aid
         the user in tracking src files.

   The relative path to the file. It will be validated when the control is
   added to the library to guarantee it does not reference a file outside the
   scope of allowed file locations.
-->
<!ELEMENT psxctl:FileLocation (#PCDATA)>
<!--
   The date/time of the file when it was stored on the server's disk,
   in international format (YYYYMMDD HH:MM:SS).
-->
<!ELEMENT psxctl:Timestamp (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT psxctl:ParamList (psxctl:Param+)>
<!--
   Typically used for custom parameters that are used to modify the behavior
   of the control. HTML params that are passed through typically won't include
   a Param element. In any case, the server will allow any param, regardless
   of whether it is included here or not. This is used by an agent such as
   the workbench to ease the designer's burden.
   If the property only allows a fixed set of values, include those in the
   ChoiceList.

   Attributes:
   name - the name of the parameter as it is passed to the control by the
         server

   datatype - a descriptive term for the type of the expected data. Recommend
         one of: String, Date, Time, Datetime, Number

   required - flag to indicate if this parameter is required. All required
         parameters must have a Param element.

   paramtype - specifies what type of parameter this is.  The possible values
         are control specific.

   Content:
   The content is the display value.

   Attributes:
   internalName - the actual name of the parameter as required by the control.
         If not present, the display value is used as the name. If the display
         name has spaces or disallowed characters, they will be replaced with
         the underscore before use.
-->
<!ELEMENT psxctl:Entry (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST psxctl:Entry
   internalName CDATA #IMPLIED

<!--
   The default value to use for the parameter if no value is supplied.  This
   may be specified for any parameter in any control.
-->
<!ELEMENT psxctl:DefaultValue (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT psxctl:Dependencies (psxctl:Dependency+)>
<!--
   A dependency is a content editor component (such as a pre-exit) whose 
   presence is required for the control to operate correctly.  Dependencies
   are enumerated in the metadata so the workbench can automatically add
   and configure them.
   
   Attributes:
   status - do the dependendent objects require (or allow) any additional
         setup? readyToGo means there are no settings for the designer to use.
         setupRequired means there are 1 or more parameters that must be set
         in order for the dependent object to function correctly. setupOptional
         means there are 1 or more parameters that may need to be setup
         depending on the situation. If setupRequired is specified, there may be
         parameters that are optional. This case can be handled with exits
         using the description for the parameter. For links, there's not much
         to be done except describe it in the controls description.

   occurrence - if this control appears more than once in a single content
         editor, should this dependent object be added for each occurrence or
         once for all occurrences. Setting this to 'single' means exactly one
         instance of this dependent object should be added to the content editor
         for 1 or more instances of this control. If set to 'multiple', then
         an object should be added for each instance of this control.

<!--
   The default element defines the type and name of the dependent object and
   provides default values for the parameters to the dependent object.
   
   The workbench supports a simple macro facility for customizing parameter
   values based on the usage of the control.  A parameter value that is part of
   a multiple occurrence dependency may consist of a single macro.  That macro 
   will be evaluated when the parameter supplies its value.
   
   All macros use the format $(macroName); the following macros are currently 
   supported:
   
      $(fieldName) - will be replaced by the html field name that this control
         is associated with
