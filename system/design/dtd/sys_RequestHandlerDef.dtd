<!--
   This file contains the DTD that specifies how the Request handler
   configuration file must be organized. The server will attempt to load all
   classes specified in the config. Each class must implement the
   IPSLoadableRequestHandler interface.
-->

<!ELEMENT RequestHandlerDefs (RequestHandlerDef+)>

<!--

   Attributes:
   handlerName - the unique name by which this handler is identified.  Used
      to identify the handler for non-rooted requests using the Rhythmyx
      Reqeust type CGI variable to identify the handler.  This will take the
      form of "extdata-<handlerName>".

   className - the fully qualified class name that implements the required
      interface.

   configFile - the relative name of the file. The handler opens the file
      and passes a stream to the handler during initialization. The file
      should be located in /<serverroot>/config/requestHandlers. If not present,
      null is passed to the init method.

<!--
   The set of request names which this handler wants to process. These names
   are equivalent to application names. To create the full URL, add the server
   root to this name.
   For example, if the RequestRoot is 'foo', the full URL would be:
      /<serverRoot>/foo/[anything else is allowed including
      resource name, extensions,query string, anchor etc.]

   Request handlers are loaded before applications. Therefore, if a root like
   'foo' is chosen, care must be excercised to make sure
   the name is unique. If there also happens to be an application
   by this name, and that application is active, the request handler will never
   get to process the request, it will always be handled by the application
   handler.
   For a handler to gain control, not only the request root, but also the
   HTTP request type must match one of those supplied for the given root.
-->
<!ELEMENT RequestRoots (RequestRoot+)>

<!--

   Attributes:
   baseName - The request root that this handler will respond to.
     Leading / is optional. When the server supports categories for
     applications, this attribute will allow multi-level names such as
     foo/bar/alpha.
