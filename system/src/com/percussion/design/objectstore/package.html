<BODY>

This specification defines the object store model used by E2. It describes
the internal classes which are used by the E2 server as well as the XML
document model used to send and receive object store requests from external
applications (such as the E2 designer).</P>

<H2>Implementation Phases</H2>

<P>For phase I, the XML files received from the designer will be written to
disk in the /E2Root/ObjectStore directory. The XML files will be given the
name of the object they refer to. For instance, the XML file for an
application named Reg will be saved as Reg.xml. In this phase, only searching
for named applications will be supported.</P>

<P>The next phase, which will occur for version 1.0, will be to convert the
object store to a back-end model (eg, ODBC). During this phase we must build
a relational table generator to create a new E2 object store. Various indices
will be created on the objects to allow for more powerful searches (such as
the cataloger searching for particular object types). The XML interface and
Java classes will remain the same, but the XML data will now be generated on
the fly rather than from the file system.</P>

<H2>XML Interface</H2>

<P>There are three main XML document types defined for use in E2.
These are:</P>

<UL>
<LI>PSXServer - this document type defines the server settings. It is used to
    perform server administration requests. </LI>
<LI>PSXApplication - this document type defines the application settings.
    When the designer creates or edits an application, this document type
	should be used. This also contains all the pages (PSXPage), data sets
	(PSXDataSet), pipes (PSXPipe), private roles (PSXRole) and private
	credential aliases (PSXCredentialAlias) defined for the application.</LI>
<LI>PSXCollection - this document type is used to wrapper a set of objects of
    the same type. It is most commonly used to provide results from a catalog
	request. For instance, if the designer needs to know what public roles
	have been defined, a PSXCollection document will be returned containing
	zero or more PSXRole objects (one for each public role).</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Java Interface</H2>

<P>The Java interface to the object store is what will be used by the E2
server internally as well as any designer clients, such as the Visual
Workbench. The implementation of each varies slightly. Let's look at how
these work, making note of their differences.</P>

<A NAME="OSDiagrams" />
<P>The main focus of the initial object store implementation is the
application. The application, and its related classes, are:</P>

<H3>Using the Object Store</H3>

To load an application for editing, the following code can be used by the
client:
<pre><code>

   import java.util.Properties;
   import com.percussion.design.objectstore.*;

   ...

   // set the server info we want to connect to
   Properties props = new Properties();
   props.put("hostName", "myserver");
   props.put("loginId",  "myid");
   props.put("loginPw",  "mypw");

   try {
      // connect to the object store
      PSObjectStore os  = new PSObjectStore(props);

      try {
         // and get the named app
         PSApplication app = os.getApplication("myapp", true);
      } catch (PSLockedException le) {
         // let the world know someone else has the app locked!
      }
      } catch (PSNotFoundException nfe) {
         // let the world know the app doesn't exist!
      }

      // now we can start using the app!

      try {
         // and when we're done, we can save it
         os.saveApplication(  app,
                              true,    // release the lock, we're done
                              true,    // validate our changes
                              false);  // this should be updated, not created
      } catch (PSNonUniqueException nue) {
         // unless we renamed it, this should never happen
      } catch (PSNotLockedException nle) {
         // we lost the lock?! must have taken too long!
      }
      } catch (PSValidationException ve) {
         // we failed the validation!
      }
   } catch (PSServerException se) {
      // let the world know the server is down or the server name is bad!
   }
   } catch (PSAuthorizationException ae) {
      // let the world know we don't have access!
   }

</pre></code>

<H2>Client-Server Connectivity</H2>

The client connects to the E2 server through the web server using the
standard HTTP protocol. The E2 hook passes the request on the server for
processing, which waits for the server's reply. The reply is then sent
back to the client (requestor).

<H3>Connecting to the Object Store</H3>

<P>The client uses the PSObjectStore class to connect to the
E2 server's object store. This is done by constructing the object with the
E2 server's connectivity information. This includes the E2 server's host
name and the appropriate credentials for gaining designer access to the
E2 server. In a future version we may also allow the protocol to be
specified. Due to existing Java limitations, only HTTP can be used.
Ideally, HTTPS can also be supported to allow secure connections between
the E2 server and the designer client. The PSObjectStore sets the
request header field <code>PS-Request-Type</code> to 
<code>design-open</code>. The request contains the appropriate XML document
structure (defined in the
<A HREF="#DesignOpen">Object Store Requests</A> section)
and a URL of the form:</P>
<PRE><CODE>
   http://hostName/E2Hook
</CODE></PRE>

<P>When the E2 server gets the request, it first verifies the login
information. If this is valid, it then verifies the user is defined in the
server's ACL with designer access. If all these conditions have been met,
a cookie is returned to the client. The cookie, psdsessid, is set
to their session id for designer access. When the PSObjectStore object
on the client gets positive acknowledgement from the server,
it returns the newly constructed object. The connection is kept alive and
the session id cookie is saved. This is then sent along
with all subsequent requests to the server.</P>

<P>At this point, we've seen the differences in connecting to the object
store. You may also be wondering why RMI or CORBA was not used. To provide
secure RMI or CORBA connections, we must also license SSL support. This adds
substantial licensing issues both in terms of distribution (eg, US export
laws) and cost (RSA is expensive!). We may revisit this implementation in a
future release.</P>

<H3>Accessing Objects</H3>

<P>For Phase I of E2, the client will convert the objects to their
appropriate XML representation and send them to the server for processing.
For instance, when the client issues a request to have an application
loaded, the request will be sent to the server, along with the session
cookie. The request header field 
<code>PS-Request-Type</code> is sent with the value
<code>design-objectstore-app-load</code>. The request contains the
appropriate XML document structure (defined in the 
<A HREF="#DesignAppLoad">Object Store Requests</A> section)
and a URL of the form:</P>
<PRE><CODE>
   http://hostName/E2Hook
</PRE></CODE>

<P>This tells the server to create an XML document containing the
application's definition. This will be loaded directly from the file system
in Phase I. In a later phase, this will be done by querying the object store
and building the appropriate XML document. By specifying a mode of edit, the
designer will be granted a 30 minute lock on the application. This will
allow other readers in, but no editors. If the designer chooses not to make
changes, they should close the application, releasing its lock. If they need
an extension on their lock (eg, they need more than 30 minutes), they can
request an extension through the object store.</P>

<P>Once the XML data is received, it will then be used to construct Java
objects. Based upon the XML data, the appropriate mutators will be called
on the newly constructed objects.</P>

<P>The PSXmlObjectStoreHandler, which will be used in Phase I rather than
the PSBackEndObjectStoreHandler, loads the applications
from disk. It will search the /E2/ObjectStore directory for a
file named appName.xml and return its contents.</P>

<A NAME="ObjectStoreRequests"></A><H2>Object Store Requests</H2>

Object store requests are sent using various headers and the contents of
an XML file as the request data. The PS-Request-Type value and its
associated structures are defined below.

<A NAME="DesignAppList"></A><H3>design-objectstore-app-list</H3>

This command is used to get a list of applications. The data to retrieve
for each application can be specified in the request.
The request headers are:

<UL>
<LI>PS-Request-Type: design-objectstore-app-list</LI>
<LI>Content-Type: text/xml</LI>
</UL>

The request contents use the following XML document structure:

<PRE><CODE>
   &lt;!ELEMENT PSXDesignAppList (columnName*)&gt;

   &lt;!--
      the attributes associated with this request:
      
      sessid - the design session id associated with the requestor
      (returned by a design-open call).
    --&gt;
   &lt;!ATTLIST PSXDesignAppList
      sessid         CDATA       #REQUIRED
   &gt;

   &lt;!-- the name of a column to include in the results
    --&gt;
   &lt;!ELEMENT columnName       (#PCDATA)&gt;
</CODE></PRE>

<P>The response contents use the following XML document structure:</P>

<PRE><CODE>
   &lt;!ELEMENT PSXDesignAppListResults (	(PSXApplicationSummary*) |
														PSXError)&gt;

   &lt;!--
		one column is returned for each piece of summary info. The attribute
		name is set to the summary type name and the value is the returned
		data.
