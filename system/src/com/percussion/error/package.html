<BODY>

This package defines the error handling model used by E2. The error handling
mechanism serves a few purposes:
<ul>
<li>log sufficient information to debug problems</li>
<li>send notification to application/data administrators</li>
<li>provide application level error management</li>
<li>provide an easily internationalized interface</li>
</ul>


<H2>Implementation Phases</H2>

The following tasks will be implemented in Phase I:
<ul>
<li>log sufficient information to debug problems</li>
<li>provide application level error customization</li>
<li>provide an easily internationalized interface</li>
</ul>

The following tasks will be implemented for Version 1.0:
<ul>
<li>send notification to application/data administrators</li>
</ul>


<H2>Reporting Errors</H2>

When processing an application specific request, the application's error
handler should be used. This can be accessed by calling the
{@link com.percussion.server.PSApplicationHandler#getErrorHandler getErrorHandler}
method of the appropriate PSApplicationHandler object. When in the context
of a data request processing component which has access to the
{@link com.percussion.data.PSExecutionData PSExecutionData} object,
its {@link com.percussion.data.PSExecutionData#getErrorHandler getErrorHandler}
method can be used instead.

To report the error, construct the appropriate PSLogError subclass. These
are classes contained in this package with names of the form PS*Error, such
as PSApplicationAuthorizationError. This can then be passed to the
{@link com.percussion.error.PSErrorHandler#reportError reportError} method.
This method will log the error, send notification (if enabled) and prepare
the response for the requestor.


<H2>Error Management - Behind the Scenes</H2>

Error management consists of a few key pieces. We must log the error
information to the E2 log for debugging purposes. For errors requiring
an administrator to be notified, the notification must be sent. We may also
need to provide a custom error response to the user.

<H3>Logging Error Information</H3>

Errors will be logged through the 
{@link com.percussion.log.PSLogError PSLogError} class and its sub-classes,
which are defined in this package. For a detailed description of how
logging is done, see the package {@link com.percussion.log} for details.

<H3>Sending Notification</H3>


<H3>Application Error Customization</H3>


<H3>Internationalization</H3>

Internationalization is accomplished in E2 by creating resource bundles
backed by properties files. Property-backed resource bundles are
implemented by extending the java.util.PropertyResourceBundle class. The
names of the E2 classes and their associated properties files are as follows:
<table border="1">
   <tr><th>Class</th><th>Property File</th></tr>
   <tr><td>ErrorStringBundle</td>
       <td>ErrorStringBundle{_locale}.properties</td></tr>
   <tr><td>LogStringBundle</td>
       <td>LogStringBundle{_locale}.properties</td></tr>
</table>

<P>Notice the {_locale} in the property file names. Resource
bundles are defined by specifying a property file with no locale
for the default bundle, and the appropriate locale for other bundles. For
instance, to support French, German and English, where English is the
default, the following can be defined:</P>

<table border="1">
   <tr><th>Locale (language)</th><th>Manager Class</th><th>Property File</th></tr>
   <tr><td>French</td>
       <td>ErrorStringBundle</td>
       <td>ErrorStringBundle_fr.properties</td></tr>
   <tr><td>German</td>
       <td>ErrorStringBundle</td>
       <td>ErrorStringBundle_de.properties</td></tr>
   <tr><td>English</td>
       <td>ErrorStringBundle</td>
       <td>ErrorStringBundle.properties</td></tr>
</table>

<P>We take a slightly different approach when dealing with the error pages
(style sheets) we return. Since the error pages may contain a substantial
amount of text, we are using a directory structure for these. We will follow
the same mechanism used by Java for resolving resource bundles. Our error
pages will be defined in the <code>Defaults/Errors</code> subdirectory of
the <code>E2</code> directory. Within this subdirectory, the files will be
listed using the naming convention {ErrorCode}{_locale}.{xsl | html}.
