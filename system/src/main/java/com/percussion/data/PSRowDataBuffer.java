            sql type. We created a map to fixup the types in PSSqlBuilder.
            In 1.3, the datetimes now have the correct type, but all NLS types
            have the type OTHER. I would expect this to mean that if they are
            passed to the getObject method, it would handle them correctly.
            Uh-uh. It does nothing with these types. So what I do here is get
            the sql type from the result set, which is the underlying sql type,
            and use that with the map. The map converts all of the NLS types

            don't want to build our own JRE again, so I'm doing work-arounds
            here, one of which is very ugly. All the bugs have been reported
            in the Java Bug Report (bug ids listed first). I limit the scope
            of these hacks to the bridge driver by checking the datatype of
            the result set.

            1.Bug Id  4400343: ResultSet.getString() returns "" if datatype is
            LONGVARCHAR and length is 1.
            [I fix this by using the getCharacterStream() method rather than
            the getString method we used to use. Because of a bug with this
            method for datatype ntext, I can't use it for all LONGVARCHAR
            types.] This was the original fix. However, it only worked for
            1.3.1, not 1.3.0. In the latter, we had to use getAsciiStream or
            we got back a null between every character.

            2. Bug Id  4404714: SQL Server: getString() on text column with
            null value throws Exception. (This is fixed in 3.1.1)
            This bug occurs due to another bug in the driver that causes the
            column length to be returned as INT_MAX or 1 less all the time,
            even when the column is null. Because of this, the code goes into
            a block (that was added in 1.3) to use getAsciiStream. Of course
            a null stream is returned (correctly), but the return is never
            checked. In 1.3.1, a NullPointerException is thrown. I get around
            this by catching the Exception and setting the colData to null.
            In 1.3.0, the NullPtrExc is caught and wrapped in a SQLException.
            It would be very ugly to differentiate this exception from a valid
            one, so in this case, we use getAsciiStream instead.

            3. Bug Id  4379373: UTF-16 returned as UTF-8 from SQL Server for
            type ntext field (nvarchar OK).
            This is VERY bizarre. An example will explain it best. If I have
            the string "abc" in the database, what I get back is the following
            string "610062006300". The astute observer will notice that this
            is a representation of the Unicode-16 hex values in little endian
            format. I used this knowledge and created a fixup routine that
            converts such a string to its proper form. I only do this for
            ntext fields.
            NOTE: This will have to be removed once we upgrade (assuming they
            fix the problem).

            You'll notice that I get the native type from the result set meta
            data to determine what to do. This is because the java types for
            all nls datatypes are 1111, which is not very useful. These are
            converted to the corresponding non-nls type at the top of this
            method.
